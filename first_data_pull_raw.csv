10487409466_10154227804239467,"[admin] Hi friends, we are gathered here today to learn about Being Excellent.

Being Excellent to other spotters is pretty easy! In order to Be Excellent to Each Other, you just have to do the following:

1. If someone breaks the rules, report to admin before taking any action.
2. If someone has asked for context on a domestic post already, there's no need to ask again. 
3. If no one has asked for context on a spot, and it's a few hours old (over 5), report to admin. OP probably won't still be around.
4. If someone has broken the rules, report to admin. It's what we're here for.
5. If someone is being decidedly Not Excellent in the comments, report to admin.

Failure to Be Excellent will have most unTriumphant consequences. It's one of our top rules for a reason, friends!",Megan Kipperman,,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154237844684108&set=gm.10154227804239467&type=3,2016-06-04 20:21:36,188,39,0,173,13,1,0,0,1

But there was this doggo in a house near the airbnb I'm staying that is so huge I was really scared to approach him. I carefully did it and after a week I scratched his ears. Now, he comes running every day to meet me when I walk by his house (I think he can even recognize my footsteps now because yesterday I was walking and before he came to view, he was already looking for me). He's the biggest and most gentle doggo and I love him.
